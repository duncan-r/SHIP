"""

 Summary:
    Contains the ATool class an interface that all tools (i.e. file loaders,
    etc) should inherit.

    This was a integral part of these tools when they were written in Java
    as they allowed the user interface to communicate with the tools through
    an observer. In Python it's not needed because of the signal slot
    mechanism making everything a lot easier.

    The interface is kept partly because it may still be useful and partly
    because I'm sure there will be a need to have all similar tools grouped
    at some point.

    Any class that functions as a tool for processing the files etc should

    Note:
        This is not currently used in any part of the software at the moment.
        It was needed in the original Java implementation in order to allow
        tools to talk to the Gui through an aobserver interface.

        It is here in case it's needed but it is probably unnecessary because
        of the signal-slot mechanism of the Qt library which makes this kind
        of thing very simple.

        Re-visit whether an Observer pattern is required once we have some
        threading setup. Although Qt does that all so well I very much
        doubt that this interface is required.

 Summary:
    Contains the RowDataCollection object. This is an object used to hold
    all of the data for a specific row of a unit in an ISIS dat file.
    It acts a collection pattern to make accessing and updating the contents
    of a row simpler.

    """Composite/Facade for the ADataRowObject classes.

    AUnit classes should instantiate this class in order to manage all the
    ADataRowObject classes used to hold the units row data.
    There are several convenience methods to retrieve and safely update the
    contents.

    Note:
        There are many references to a 'key' variable in this class to decipher
        which object in the collection to access/update/etc. This is one of
        the ROW_DATA_TYPES enum values in the datunits package.

    See Also:
        ROW_DATA_TYPE - in :class:'datunits <ship.fmp.datunits>' module.

    TODO:
          Need to find a way to safely add values to the collection while making
          sure that all the data objects stay in sync (i.e. have the same number
          of rows), otherwise it will be chaos. At the moment this is tricky
          because we need to add individual values at the start. Possibly stop
          client from using any get methods etc unless all the data objects have
          the same number of rows. For the time being there is a convenience
          method checkRowsInSync() that can be called to verify that all of the
          data objects in this collection have the same length.
